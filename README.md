# EconoMe

EconoMe is an attempt at creating a currency/banking system that is usable by any games.\
Existing as either a library that is embedded into the game or the games server\
or as a separate web server that handles transactions via a REST API.

It's still very much in early stages and I do not have a full plan for it just yet.\
